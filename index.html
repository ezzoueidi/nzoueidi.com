I am just a *FOSS* contributor who is interested currently on the development of the kernel. of course Linux.<br/>
I am an OSSA engineer at Linagora. When I have a free time or when I'm not trying to pay the bills, I'm a contributor to the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/nzoueidi">Ubuntu community</a>.<br/>

<b>About this site</b>
<br/><br/>
This little piece of site is a way to keep track of stuff that I am thinking about or working on. <br/>
I research things that I find interesting, then document my findings with a public blog post, which I can refer to later. <br/>
Hopefully other people will find these posts helpful, relevant, or interesting. <br/><br/>
