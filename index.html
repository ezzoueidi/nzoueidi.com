<b>About this blog</b>
<br/>
This blog is way to keep track of stuff that I am thinking about or working on. <br/>
I research things that I find interesting, then document my findings with a public blog post, which I can refer to later. <br/>
Hopefully other people will find these posts helpful, relevant, or interesting. <br/>
