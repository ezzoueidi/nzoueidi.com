By talking about <b>Goroutines</b>, the first thought that will come to your mind is <b>Concurrency</b>.<br/>
Which is somehow true, I will not define here what is Concurrency and how it is different than Parallelism. <br/>
<b> Goroutines </b> exists only in the virtual space of go runtime and not in the OS. <br/>
and they are managed by <b>Go Runtime scheduler</b> which is needed to handle the whole lifecycle of given goroutines.<br/>
