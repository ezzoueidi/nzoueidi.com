Hello all, well first of all I am writing this post for a couple of reasons. In the fact for <b>three reasons.</b><br/>
<ol><li>
		I believe that everyone should be using encryption and signatures in their email and I believe that if you<br/>
	       	are already using a mail client such as Mutt (which a few of people are), then there is absolutely no reason<br/>
	       	for you not to be using PGP-compatible software. :) <br/></li>  

	<li>all of the documentation that I've seen thus far is geared toward someone who is already familiar with PGP, <br/>
		so it just explains things like how to configure Mutt to do such tasks as automatically sign outgoing messages<br/>
	       	or write a procmail recipe to rewrite old-style inline PGP messages as S/MIME messages.<br/>


		<li>I enjoy writing posts, especially that this is my 1st post and I hope that this one is of use to many people.  I did a lot of research <br/>
			and I figured a number of things out on my own, and now I want to help people along.</li>
</ol>
