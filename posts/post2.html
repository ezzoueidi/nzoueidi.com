Hello all, in this post I am not going to show how you could install tmux or how to configure it, those things are well documented on the net. <br/>
So, what you need is duckduck it and you will see a lot of tutorials.. <br/>
What I am going to write here is the power of tmux and why every developer/sysadmin need it. <br/>
<br/>
First of all, why they call it <b>TMux</b>? <br/>
It is because <b>T</b> stand for <b>T</b>erminal and <b>Mux</b> for<b> Mu</b>ltiple<b>x</b>er.<br/>
Based on WiKipedia<b>[1]</b> Multiplexer means one thing do a lot of different things.. <br/><br/>
<br/>
OK, so let's begin with 
what I like the most in tmux is that supports both vertical and horizontal splits whereas GNU Screen only supported one of the two.<br/>
One of the other reasons too, is for pair programming. <br/>
Let's say you are working with a big team and all persons need to look how you code in the real time.. It would be much better to all SSH into a single box and watch you edits code. <br/>
Rather than crowding around your laptop, which isn't feasible given the seating arrangements at play.<br/>
The final and the most important reason for me is long running processes on random servers. I have a VM with an Ubuntu install for various things (testing, packaging, etc..),<br/>
I have a tmux session which helps provide me context from one editing session to another.<br/>
Tmux is also a boon when dealing with a flaky wifi connection. Being able to resume the in-progress terminal screen is nice, so you don't have orphaned processes when your connection dies.<br/>  
<br/>
Terminal multiplexers have a command mode in which you can tell it to do something, such as switching virtual consoles or creating new ones.<br/>
In tmux the short-cut key to this command mode, called the prefix, is by default Ctrl-b, but if you want to change it, very simple just add the following to your ~/.tmux.conf <br/>
<br/><code>
# Set the prefix to ^A<br/>
unbind C-b<br/>
set -g prefix ^A<br/><br/>

# So that you can go to the beginning of the line with ^A a<br/>
bind a send-prefix<br/>
</code><br/>
Ctrl-a is in my opinion also easier to reach than Ctrl-b. <br/>
So, I will use Ctrl-a as the prefix key in the rest of this article. It will be shown as ^A. <br/><br/>
Now that you are ready to use tmux, start it up. I make it a habit to give each tmux session a name, so that I can easily re-attach it by using the name: <br/>
<code>
$ tmux new -s base
</code><br/>
In this example, I have called the tmux session "base". <br/>
But rather than executing this command everytime when you open your terminal, you add this line to your ~/.zshrc if you are using ZSH or ~/.bashrc if you are using BASH  <br/>
<br/><code> tmux attach -t base || tmux new -s base</code>
<br/>
Allright, so let's say you want to create some virtual consoles. Hit <code>^A c</code>. In the status bar, you will see that you have created another virtual console, with bash/zsh running in it.<br/>
The <b>*</b> means that that one is currently shown. Start any CLI tool and the name of your virtual console will change depending to what you have opened.<br/>
I think you are wondering I wanna set up a uniq name to my virtual console! Yep you can hit <code>^A ,</code> and rename it! :D <br/>
So, now I have more then one virtual console, how can I switch from one to another? Simply to switch hit <code>^A p </code>or<code> ^A n</code><br/>
The letters stand for previous and next console. Likewise, you can switch using numbers <code>^A 0 </code> for the 1st console and 1 for the 2nd etc.. <br/><br/>
In Tmux also you can split windows vertically and horizontally using the prefix which is<code> ^A</code> and <b> %</b> for vertical split and <b>" </b> for horizontal split.<br/>
To navigate through spliw windows, you can use <code>^A o</code> but I prefer using <code>^A arrow keys</code> <br/>
Resizing the split windows is pretty easy also, keep the Control key pressed and use you the arrow keys to resize the currently focused spliw window<br/>
One of the great features of Tmux is that you can deattach and reattach your tmux session whenever you want!<br/>
Deattaching it simply with <code>^A d </code> and if you want to reattach it, remember the name of the dettached session, if you forgot it is okay! <code> tmux ls </code> will list yo you all your tumux sessions<br/>
then like I mention above to reattach it <code> tmux attach -t name_of_your_session </code>
Allright, I will stop here and I will try to post another article about advanced/further customizations.<br/>
I am trying to keep this article short and not boring as it is :P <br/>
That's it, thank you for reading and feel free to send me a mail if you noticed that there's a typos or something is not enough clear!
