<center><b>A several ways to contribute to the Linux kernel</b></center> <br/><br/>

Hello all, this is my 2nd post I will talk about the Linux kernel, I will mention some importants tricks & questions every begineer <br/>
wanna know them to start his career on the Linux kernel!<br/>
Well, first of all let's start by asking why I need to learn this! Should I be an extra skilled ninja on C programming?<br/>
Should I know all the commands of Linux! :O <br/>
Haha, the answer is very simple, you don't need to be a <b>ninja</b> guy on C nor on the commands of Linux! <br/><br/>
All what you need is the willing to learn/help/contribute ;) <br/>
OK, let's begin then <br/>
You need to know some <b>GIT</b><i>[1]</i> commands, here is a brief of what you need mostly on this road. <br/>
<code> git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git </code> <br/>
Here what we are doing, is that we are telling git to clone us this repository to our local machine.<br/>
Then, the next step is to go to the place where we cloned our repository and create a branch to write and compile/build our patch <br/>
into the kernel <br/>
<code> git branch tutorial</code><br/>
OK, let's see in what branch we are, <code> git status </code> it will give you if you are in the right place <code> On branch master </code> <br/>
Let's see the last commit which is generaly made by Linus <code> git show HEAD</code> <br/>
So to switch to our new branch we do simply <code> git checkout tutorial </code><br/>
Let's start looking to make a patch! There's a good tool made by Perl[2] language we can find it in scripts/checkpatch.pl <br/>
Until now, we don't know how we can use it so let's run <code>scripts/checkpatch.pl --help</code> you can find a useful informations there. <br/>
That script actually it search if there is some code style[3] problems and tells you kindly to fix it! :D The normal use of this tool is <br/>
<code scripts/checkpatch.pl <b>-f</b> any_file_you_like_to_check_it </code> <br/>
It shows you something like that if the file have some things to fix. <br/>
<code>
ERROR: REASON <br/>
#LINE: FILE: PATH_OF_THE_FILE:LINE:<br/>
+ THE LINE YOU NEED TO EDIT IT<br/><br/>

WARNING: REASON<br/>
