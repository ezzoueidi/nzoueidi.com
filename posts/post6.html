<br/><br/><br/>
Hey, after digging and searching all over the net about some tutos, on how to write your own kernel from the scratch, I found that all those tutos/posts <br/>
are based on x86 computers, nor are not well clarified. <br/><br/>
Like you know, I am very addicted to the low level stuff, so it would be a great huge post for me! :D I hope I can finished ASAP. <br/><br/>
OK, so we will need in this article some tools which are : <b>gcc</b>, <b>vim</b>, <b>nasm</b>, <b>ld</b>, <b>grub2</b> <br/>
<br/><br/>
Source code is available at my <a href="https://github.com/nzoueidi">GitHub repository</a><br/><br/>
Alright, so before the show begins, I wanna explain the machine boots up and transfers control to the kernel!<br/>
When we press the poweron button, the magick begins by sending a signal from the motherboard to the power supply.<br/>
After receiving the signal, the power supply provides the proper amount of electricity to the computer. <br/>
Once the motherboard receives the power good signal, it tries to start the CPU.<br/>
The CPU resets all leftover data in its registers and sets up predefined values for each of them.<br/>
And when we go deeper to the real mode[0] and memory addressing, the CS register consists of two parts: the visible segment selector, and the hidden base address.<br/>
The RIP is by default with the value <b>0xFFFFFFF0</b>
