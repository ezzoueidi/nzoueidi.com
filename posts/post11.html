<center><b>A tour into k8s's code </b> </center>
<br/><hr>
<br/>
Hello friends, I have been busy with the real life so I didn't post any article the few past months</a><br/>
This list consist about some of the main components of k8s and how they work from code until runtime<br/>
If you are willing to contribute to k8s in any ways, this article will include some sub-articles about k8s's internals. <br/>
This is not the final list, expect any item to be added, as usual if you ntoiced any typo please feel free to hack the article in Github, I will be more than happy! <br/>
Likewise, if you think I forgot to mention anything, do not hesitate to add it ;)<br/>

<ol>
	<ul> The magic behind a simple kubectl command!<br/> </ul>
	<ul> How the API of k8s works - deep dive <br/></ul>
	<ul> Every piece of code behind RBAC<br/></ul>
	<ol> How things been scheduled in k8s</br></ol>
</ol>
<br/>
As mentioned above, I will write an article each time from that list and publish it into this list of articles that belongs to k8s. <br/>
If you don't know k8s or you don't have any expertise on Go, I don't recommend you these articles. Please refer to any articles in the net talking about the basics<br/>
of k8s and how you can operate your own k8s cluster. <br/><br/>
For the records, I am not an expert and am just reading and learning and trying to write what I have learned during my journey in a simple way.

Cheers <b>o/</b>
