Hey folks, the most challenging tasks given to a person who runs Kubernetes in production is to take backups and apply a disaster recovery plan(s) to roll back whenever it is needed.<br/>
There are many methods and techniques to do so, I am gonna list many ways to implement the disaster recovery and the backups.<br/>
First of all, the question that need to be asked is:<br/>
What are the most important pieces in a kubernetes cluster that need to be backed up?<br/>
As all the resources in k8s are treated as an API object. I would say then everything is important unless you have a limited storage where you gonna apply your backup!<br/>
In this case, you may want to backup your microservice application(s) that is/are running on your k8s cluster (data). Besides, the <b>etcd*</b> components <i>(etcd and etcd-events)</i>.<br/> 
This is in my opinion the most importnant critical pieces but until here we are talking only about backups but what are their values if we could not apply them!<br/>
This is what I will try to cover later in the article.<br/>
Let's go into the manual way that will allow us to take backups on our kubernetes cluster.<br/><br/>
I am assuming here that there is only one master. If you have many you can repeat the same process on all the master nodes you have. <br/>
In order to back up your <b>etcd</b>, we need the <b>certificates</b>.<br/>
<pre>
$ sudo cp -r /etc/kubernetes/pki backup/
$ sudo docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/backup:/backup --network host -v /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd:/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd --env ETCDCT_API=3 k8s.gcr.io/etcd-amd64:3.2.18 \
etcdctl --endpoint=https://127.0.0.1:2379 --cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt --cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/healthcheck-client.py snapshot save /backup/etcd.db
</pre> 
To restore the etcd <b>backup</b>, you will need to perform the backup you just took the inverse way. You will just need to replace <code>save</code> by <code>restore</code><br/>
and then move the data back to <code>/var/lib/etcd/</code><br/>
To automate this process you can create a <b>cronjob</b> in Kubernetes. The documentation is so clear<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/" target="_blank">[1]</a> and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/" target="_blank">[2]</a><br/>
However, the tool that I like the most about backup and disaster recovery where I started contributing recently is <a href="https://github.com/heptio/velero" target="_blank">Velero</a>. <br/>
This tool is written by Golang and developed by <a href="https://heptio.com/" target="_blank">Heptio</a> folks. In a short words, Velero consists of a server that runs on your cluster and a CLI that runs locally.<br/>
What makes it very powerfull is that it supports many cloud providers and of course on-premise infrastructures. It gives you the ability to copy your cluster resources to other clusters and replicates your environment.<br/>
You can install Velero by downloading the <a href="https://github.com/heptio/velero/releases" target="_blank">latest release</a> or just clone the <a href="https://github.com/heptio/velero" target="_blank">code</a> and checkout the appropriate tag you would work with.<br/>
To set up your server, you need to start the local storage service by applying some yaml files.<br/>
<pre>
$ kubectl apply -f examples/common/00-prereqs.yaml
$ kubectl apply -f examples/minio/
</pre>
That's it! Pretty easy. You will now simulate a deployment by creating any example (e.g: nginx deployment). Then try to back up it. <br/>
<pre>
$ velero backup create test-backup --selector label=value
</pre>
or if you would like to backup a namespace in your cluster, including everything.<br/>
<pre>
$ velero backup create test-backup --include-namespaces examples_namespace
</pre>
Otherwise, if you want to backup all objects except those matching the label <code>label=ignore</code>
<pre>
$ velero backup create test-backup --select 'label notin (ignore)'
</pre>
You can add <code>--schedule</code> flag to make scheduled backups. The scheduling will be on a cron <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#CRON_expression" target="_blank">expression</a><br/>
Then, if you want to restore your backups, you need to run <code> velero restore create --from-backup test-backup</code><br/>
The same as <code>kubectl</code>, you can describe your backups, first by getting the name of the restore then by describing it. <br/>
<pre>
$ velero restore get 
$ velero restore describe restore_name
</pre>
Finally, you can delete backups that you took by doing <code> velero backup delete test-backup</code>.
