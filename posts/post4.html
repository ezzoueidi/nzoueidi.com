Hi folks! I will try my best to finish and add posts here in this collection. <br/>
I think you are here and guessing about the subject/topic related to this post. Well, this a serie for couple collection about the Linux kernel <br/>
and some low level stuff! Amazing right? :P Meanwhile, I am learning and trying to post here each time! <br/>
<b>Q :</b> Why I choosed the name of this collection : "<b>Into the wild!</b>"?<br/>
<b>A : </b> I have choosed this name because of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Into_the_Wild_(film)">film</a>, just watch it and you will know why I named this collection like that! :D <br/>
I will try to make things more easier/clearer for the reader and I hope that I can do it! :D <br/>
Alright, without any further talking here is a brief list of what I am going to talk about <br/><br/>
<b>PS : </b> I am not a ninja guy with low level stuff, I am learning just like you. So if you noticed any things that are not right, feel free to hack it <br/>
