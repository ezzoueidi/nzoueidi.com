Hello all, after the 1st article <a href="">Behind the scenes!</a> in our collection "Into the wild!" and after mention not once the stack<br/>
So, this article is about undestanding the stack, why and how it works. <br/><br/>
Without speaking much, the stack is when a program starts executing, a certain contiguous section of memory is set aside for the program called the stack. <br/>
And this is a picture describes almost everything.<br/><br/>

In brief talking, the stack is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according to the last-in first-out (LIFO) principle.<br/>
In the pushdown stacks only two operations are allowed: push the item into the stack, and pop the item out of the stack. <br/>
A stack is a limited access data structure - elements can be added and removed from the stack only at the top. push adds an item to the top of the stack, pop removes the item from the top.<br/> 
A helpful analogy is to think of a stack of books; you can remove only the top book, also you can add a new book on the top.<br/>
